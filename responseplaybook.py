print("Security Incident Response Playbook")

# Introduction
print("Introduction")
print("This document outlines the procedures to be followed in the event of a security incident.")
print("The goal of these procedures is to minimize the impact of the incident and to prevent future incidents from occurring.")
print("This playbook covers the following security incidents:")
print("* Malware infection")
print("* Data breach")
print("* Denial-of-service attack\n")

# Incident Handling Procedures
print("Incident Handling Procedures")

# Malware Infection
print("Malware Infection")

# Identification
print("Identification")
print("1. Isolate the infected machine from the network.")
print("2. Confirm that the machine is infected with malware using antivirus software.")
print("3. Identify the type of malware and the extent of the infection.\n")

# Containment
print("Containment")
print("1. Determine the scope of the infection and identify any other machines that may be infected.")
print("2. Disable network access for the infected machines.")
print("3. Implement firewall rules to block traffic from the infected machine(s) to prevent the spread of the malware.\n")

# Eradication
print("Eradication")
print("1. Remove the malware from the infected machine(s) using antivirus software.")
print("2. Restore any files that were modified or deleted by the malware.")
print("3. Update the antivirus software and definitions on all machines.\n")

# Recovery
print("Recovery")
print("1. Verify that the infected machine(s) have been cleaned and are free of malware.")
print("2. Restore network access for the cleaned machine(s).")
print("3. Conduct a post-incident review to identify any weaknesses in the organization's security posture that may have allowed the malware to infect the network.\n")

# Data Breach
print("Data Breach")

# Identification
print("Identification")
print("1. Confirm that a data breach has occurred.")
print("2. Identify the type of data that has been breached.")
print("3. Determine the extent of the breach and the systems or devices that have been affected.\n")

# Containment
print("Containment")
print("1. Isolate the affected systems or devices from the network.")
print("2. Implement firewall rules to block traffic from the affected systems or devices to prevent further exfiltration of data.")
print("3. Preserve evidence for forensic analysis.\n")

# Eradication
print("Eradication")
print("1. Remove any malware or other malicious software that was used to facilitate the breach.")
print("2. Restore any modified or deleted data.")
print("3. Update security controls, including antivirus software, firewall rules, and access controls.")

# Recovery
print("Recovery")
print("1. Restore the affected systems or devices to their pre-breach state.")
print("2. Conduct a post-incident review to identify any weaknesses in the organization's security posture that may have allowed the breach to occur.")
print("3. Implement any necessary changes to prevent future breaches.")

# Denial-of-Service Attack
print("Denial-of-Service Attack")

# Identification
print("Identification")
print("1. Identify that a denial-of-service attack is in progress.")
print("2. Determine the source and type of attack.")

# Containment
print("Containment")
print("1. Block the source of the attack using firewall rules or other security controls.")
print("Identify any affected systems or devices and isolate them from the network.")

# Eradication
print("Eradication")
print("1. Mitigate the effects of the attack by implementing additional security controls, such as load balancing or rate limiting.")
print("2. Monitor the network for any signs of continued attack.")

# Recovery
print("Recovery")
print("1. Restore any affected systems or devices to their pre-attack state.")
print("2. Conduct a post-incident review to identify any weaknesses in the organization's security posture that may have allowed the attack to occur.")
print("3. Implement any necessary changes to prevent future attacks.")

# Conclusion
print("Conclusion")
print("This security incident response playbook outlines the procedures to be followed in the event of a security incident."
"By following these procedures, organizations can minimize the impact of security incidents and prevent future incidents from occurring."
"It is important to regularly review and update this playbook to reflect changes in the organization's security posture and to ensure that it remains effective.")
